In the heart of a bustling city, nestled between the clang of modernity and the whispers of history, stood an inconspicuous antique shop. Inside, amidst dusty tomes and forgotten relics, a peculiar clock caught the eye of curious wanderer Ella. Unlike any other, this clock didn’t just mark the passage of time—it was rumored to hold the power to traverse the ages. As Ella's fingers brushed the clock’s ornate surface, a strange sensation enveloped her, and in an instant, she found herself standing in a distant, unfamiliar world, far from the present she once knew.
In ancient Mesopotamia, the cradle of civilization, the Sumerians invented the earliest form of 
writing known as cuneiform. This innovation marked the beginning of recorded history, enabling 
the documentation of trade, laws, and epic tales such as the Epic of Gilgamesh. Mesopotamian 
society thrived along the fertile banks of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, laying the 
foundation for modern urban culture.
